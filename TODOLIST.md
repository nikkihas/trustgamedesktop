## Level09
- There are 9 platform of which Charlie can step on. When Charlie does, the platform lowers, the sound "Level_09_Right" or "Level_09_Left" plays and the door opens further or closes completely
The idea is that people think they can find a pattern in the platforms however there is none. Each time the door opens further it moves with x-0.6 or x+0.6, x=-0.36 & x=0.36 is the max, so after max 6 tries the door closes again. But too keep it random let's say it closes after 2-6 times.
When the door opens a bit further play level_09_right if the door resets play "Lvl_09_left.
The platform lowers while players stand on it

The instruction voice over will eventually tell the players to kill themselves (which is the solution)
