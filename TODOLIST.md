# To do list (36 hours total)

## Intro
- Next Level after 49 seconds
	
## Level 09 (is not possible to build in the remaining time)
- On button down 85% "right" door opens a little, 15% "wrong" door resets and closes
- Button down doesn't change color, it only pushes the little hexagon within the big hexagon, when the player steps away the hexagon goes back up
- Instead of opening the doors with rotation, the doors now open with moving the x position
- Remove old platform (I kept it there in case you need to see how I made the previous version.
