# To do list (37 hours total)

## Level09

## Level08
- Stop audio when you leave trigger (, tried to fix it but it didn’t work out).
- Rotate "Hexagon" gameObject 30 degrees on press x (works only in trigger) (found in "InteractiveObjects")

## General
- Mountain Moving script
- Fix bug with audio sources playing through each other.
- Script: Go to "End" scene when TotalTime = 0
- Fade out to black when dying, Fade in on Respawm

## Level05:
- Reset timelimit if Position resets

## To do Nikki
- Highscore
- Simplify Level05

- I think it is good to put Level02 back, the game feels weird without it.
- Reset game function can be found in the GlobalVariables script (, press Cross, Square and Start at the same time).
- Adjusted time till hitbox destroys itself, to prevent Charlie from hitting it twice.
- GameTimer currently loads scene 7, change this value when you add or remove levels.
- Intro appears to be cut short, couldn’t find NextLevelTime script in the scene, it should be placed on GameManager.

## Did Nikki
- Change GUI.Label style
- Added Hexagon to Level08
- Changed "NextLevelTime" to go to "End"
- Changed camera size for zoom on TVs
